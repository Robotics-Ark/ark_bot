## Bill Of Materials
The parts ordered from either side (amazon or cheapest) are the same parts, the difference in time and price. The amazon links will come significantly faster whilst the others will take a while longer.
At the bottom though there are two different PLA filaments, the bambu or an equivalent high brand printer filament is reccomended, but if on a budget, the amazon ones will work fine.
